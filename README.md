# BIG-aiR
An AI virtual snowboard trainer for Queen's ESSDEV club

We are using a custom sensor pack including insole piezoresistive pressure sensors, gyroscopes, and accelerometers to train a RNN model to learn snowboard tricks.
We have a website that takes in the sensor data from an SD card and generates remedial feedback on unsucessful attempts.
