whats up guys
So today we went over our general plan of attack for the next few weeks and how the projkect architecture is gonna look.

For next week:
1. Please push a text file to your branch using git if you havent done so already (youtube videos in resources to help you)
2. Please download the data csv file thats in the data folder, and create a Python file that will...
  a) turn the csv data into a panda dataframe
  b) search through that dataframe looking for when the rider is in the air (when sesnor values drop)
  c) seperate each time the rider is in the air as a "trick" and create another data frame with all the data from one second before to one second after the jump. Name is 'trick#'.
  d) print all the trick dataframes to the serial

Let me know if you guys have any questions!!
